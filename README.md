This repository contains how to use Snowflake for cloud data warehousing, Snowpipe for automatic data loading, and Snowpark for data transformation using Python. Data from a cloud storage (like Azure Blob or AWS S3) is continuously ingested into Snowflake tables through Snowpipe. Once the data is available, Snowpark is used to process, clean, and analyze it directly inside Snowflake using Python code. This helps automate the data pipeline and enables powerful analytics without moving data out of Snowflake.
